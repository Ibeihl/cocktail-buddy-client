## Features
Users can create an account, then have access to Cocktail Buddy's hand picked selection of classic cocktails.  A user can search through the preexisting drink database and add drinks to favorites.  Users can then add and remove their own drinks to their individual account, and add those to favorites and search through all the drinks.

## Target Audience
Bartenders that are looking for an easy way to organize drink recipes.  Bar or restaurant managers who want an easy place to store house recipes that can be easily accesses by employees.  Anyone who enjoys making cocktails and needs an easy way to find reliable, delicous drink recipes. 

## Tech Stack
Cocktail Buddy employs MongoDb, Express and Node on the server side, including JWT authentication, and React/Redux for the client side.

## Future Plans
We will continue to add more tried and tested drink recipes to our database so that users have access to a larger selection of drink recipes to make and inspire them.  Furthermore, Cocktail Buddy will improve the functionality of adding user drink recipes, so that a user can not only add and remove their own recipes, but edit them while without having to remove them and add them.
